\chapter{INTRODUCTION} \label{chapter:intro}

This is a template for LaTeX theses and dissertations at the University of South Alabama.
 Most of the formatting minutia are handled automagically by the macros defined in the \texttt{southalabama.cls} file.
 Some features that are not handled automatically and require the author to format input manually are discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:userresponsibilities}.
 For example, numbering and creation of references for figures, etc in the table of contents or the citations section are also automatic, but require input in a particular manner.

\section{Compiling}

To compile this document, use: \texttt{pdflatex ms; bibtex ms; makeindex ms.nlo -s nomencl.ist -o ms.nls; pdflatex ms; pdflatex ms}

The \texttt{bibtex} bit handles the references section, and the \texttt{makeindex} bit builds the nomenclature table.
 The multiple calls to \texttt{pdflatex} build the various auxiliary files and are a normal part of LaTeX life.
