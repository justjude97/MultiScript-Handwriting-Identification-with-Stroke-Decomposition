If there is anyone you would like to thank, this should go here.  
 This page is optional.  
 If you would like to not have an \texttt{acknowledgements} section, simply delete the \texttt{\textbackslash acknowledgements{}} bit in the preamble of the main \texttt{.tex} file.
 
A dedication page is also optional, but the paginations, etc have not been implemented in this template.
 If you wish to do so, the macros in \texttt{southalabama.cls} for the \texttt{\textbackslash acknowledgements{}} command should provide a good starting point.
